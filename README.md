Week 3 Team Project

# Hi-Lo
Play Hi-Lo, and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Pull the card. Guess if the number of the next card will be higher or
lower. If you guess right, you will get 100 points, if you guess wrong you loose 75 points. 

# Suits
Suits is an additional game mode for Hi-Lo that prompts the user to guess the
suit of the card, and if your answer is correct, your turn's points are doubled. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 hilo 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
